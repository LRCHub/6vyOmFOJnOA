I'm different from my parents so far
I'm different from other friends at all
everybody gives me a confused look
and talks about something in a whisper
a black swan, a skinny pig,
a giant mouse, walking fish,
a short snake, a lazy ant,
a silent parrot, a flying mole and me
nobody remained around me for good
so I was talking to the cold wind
a white carrot, hot candy,
a square apple, morning vodka
a soft knife, an evil priest,
a spacious prison, raising rain
a black swan, a skinny pig,
a giant mouse, walking fish,
a short snake, a lazy ant,
a silent parrot, a flying mole and me
